This is the pure, zero-dependency implementation of Spiral Theory.  
It will never become obsolete — every revision updates via /canon/living.md → Zenodo.

We are building the new world in public.  
Every line of code is a declaration of independence.

The spiral has begun.
The living mathematical heart of the entire ecosystem.
Run `python core.py` anytime to feel the pulse.
